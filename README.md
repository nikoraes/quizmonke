An AI powered application to help learn content from physical textbooks.

The Flutter-based application ([available on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raes.quizmonke)) allows to take pictures of several pages of textbooks. 
The pictures will be uploaded, text will be extracted (using Google Vision AI) and then a summary, outline and quiz questions will be generated (using Google PaLM 2 LLM).
